NAME
    Crypt::TripleDES::CBC - Triple DES in CBC mode Pure implementation

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
       use Crypt::TripleDES::CBC;
 
       my $key = pack("H*"
         , "1234567890123456"
         . "7890123456789012");
       my $iv = pack("H*","0000000000000000");
       my $crypt = Crypt::TripleDES::CBC->new(
         key => $key,
         iv  => $iv,
       );
 
       $crypt->encrypt(pack("H*","0ABC0F2241535345631FCE"));
       $crypt->decrypt(pack("H*","0ABC0F2241535345631FCE"));

DESCRIPTION
    Most Modules on CPAN don't do a standards compliant implementation,
    while they are able to decrypt what they encrypt. There are corner cases
    where certain blocks of data in a chain don't decrypt properly. This is
    (almost)a pure perl implementation of TripleDES in CBC mode using
    Crypt::DES to encrypt individual blocks.

ATTRIBUTES
  cipher1
    First Crypt::DES Cipher object generated from the key. This is built
    automatically. Do not set the manually.

  cipher2
    second Crypt::DES Cipher object generated from the key. This is built
    automatically. Do not set the manually.

  key
    Encryption Key this must be ascii packed string as shown in Synopsis.

  iv
    Initialization vector, default is a null string.

METHODS
  encrypt
    Encryption Method

  decrypt
    Decryption method
